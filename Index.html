<p style="background-color:red" align=justify title=ssm><font size=5 color=Pink> This is the paragraph tag and you can use it to write paragraph   When you use Notepad in Windows 10, you can remove or change headers and footers. The default header and footer settings in Notepad are:
Headers: &f
Footers: Page &p
These commands give you the title of the document on the top of the page and a page number at the bottom.

These settings can't be saved, so all header and footer settings must be entered manually each time you want to print a document.
